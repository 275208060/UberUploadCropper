************************************************************************************
** THIS example is not for production use.  It is only an example implementation! **

To use the examples you MUST give the upload directories write permissions.

There is a bit of resizing and crop work to be done on your part, this is just an 
example of how to get the script croordinating with fileuploader, Impromptu, and jcrop.

When you begin your own implementation you will need to do some image prep work in 
upload.php, as well as crop.php (or whereever you decide to place it.)
